NRI Web Development Challenge


I wrote the code using: Laravel framework Bootstrap & jQuery

Project Description

The script allows users to upload a comma delimited csv file, any other file extentions are not allowed. Once the file is uploaded the script reads the file and parses the columns and saves the values to a database table named auctioned_items.
What your web application must do:

After saving the entries to the database, the script returns a message indicating successfull upload and insertion and displays the total spending amount per-month and per-category. 

Once you're done, please submit a paragraph or two in your README about what you are particularly proud of in your implementation, and why.

I was happy to complete the project inspite of not having used Laravel in about 5 years. It was a great way to review and get back into it.
I liked the look and functionality of the File uploader and the overall color schemes and the responsive look of the updates.
